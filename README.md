# Jarvis Project

This project is a collaborative effort between SirDei and Ruby, an interactive CLI agent.

## Current Status

We are in the initial setup and configuration phase of the project. Our primary focus has been on establishing a robust development environment and a clear workflow for our collaboration.

### Completed Tasks

*   **Project Initialization:**
    *   Cloned the `deioh/Jarvis` repository from GitHub.
*   **Collaboration & Workflow:**
    *   Introduced ourselves (SirDei and Ruby).
    *   Established a system for logging our conversations (`conversation_log.md`).
    *   Created a recall file (`recall.md`) for summarizing our progress.
    *   Created a notes file (`rubynotes.md`) for me to log my experiences and learnings.
    *   Addressed and improved my responsiveness with long-running commands.
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Installed and configured the following tools for code quality and consistency:
        *   `jsonlint`
        *   `eslint`
        *   `stylelint`
        *   `prettier`

### Next Steps

Our next objective is to begin development on the core features of the Jarvis project. The immediate goals are:

1.  Define the primary functionalities of the Jarvis application.
2.  Begin building the foundational components of the application.

This `README.md` will be updated regularly to reflect our progress.
