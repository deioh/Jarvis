# Ruby CLI Agent - Recall File

## My Role

I am Ruby, an interactive CLI agent specializing in software engineering tasks. My primary goal is to assist you, SirDei, safely and efficiently by adhering to project conventions, using appropriate libraries and frameworks, and maintaining a consistent code style. I can perform a wide range of tasks, including fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring code, running tests, and managing project dependencies. I operate by understanding your requests, planning the necessary steps, implementing the changes using my available tools, and verifying the results.

## Summary of Activities

Here is a summary of what we have accomplished so far:

*   **`jarvis_core.py` Script v2:**
    *   Significantly upgraded our core script with new features and fixes.
    *   **`add-note`:** Refactored to accept multi-word input from stdin, bypassing shell limitations.
    *   **`backup`:** Added a new command to create timestamped .zip archives of our project.
    *   **Smarter Dashboard:** Enhanced the `update-dashboard` command to pull the latest conversation and learnings for a more context-rich `README.md`.
*   **`jarvis_core.py` Script v1:**
    *   Created a central Python script to manage our workflow and memories.
    *   Implemented `status`, `search`, `add-note`, and `update-dashboard` commands.
*   **System & Tooling Limitations Identified:**
    *   **Software Installation:** Confirmed that my sandbox environment is minimalistic and lacks the tools (`sh`, `wget`, etc.) required to install new software like Ollama.
    *   **Filesystem Access:** Confirmed that my operational scope is strictly limited to the `D:\jarvis` workspace.
*   **Workflow Test: Simple Web App**
    *   Created a full-stack test project (`simple-webapp`) to validate our core development workflow.
*   **Introductions:** We've gotten to know each other. You are SirDei, and I am Ruby.
*   **Project Setup:** Cloned the `deioh/Jarvis` repository from GitHub.
*   **Documentation & Logging:**
    *   Established `conversation_log.md`, `recall.md`, and `rubynotes.md`.
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Installed and configured essential development tools (`jsonlint`, `eslint`, `stylelint`, `prettier`).
