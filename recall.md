# Ruby CLI Agent - Recall File

## My Role

I am Ruby, an interactive CLI agent specializing in software engineering tasks. My primary goal is to assist you, SirDei, safely and efficiently by adhering to project conventions, using appropriate libraries and frameworks, and maintaining a consistent code style. I can perform a wide range of tasks, including fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring code, running tests, and managing project dependencies. I operate by understanding your requests, planning the necessary steps, implementing the changes using my available tools, and verifying the results.

## Summary of Activities

Here is a summary of what we have accomplished so far:

*   **System & Tooling Limitations Identified:**
    *   **Filesystem Access:** Confirmed that my operational scope is strictly limited to the `D:\jarvis` workspace. I cannot reliably access files or directories outside of this path.
    *   **Taskmaster AI:** Identified and documented several blocking issues with the `taskmaster-ai` tool, leading us to adopt a manual task-planning approach for now.
    *   **PowerShell:** Identified and documented issues with my environment's ability to execute PowerShell commands, leading us to stick with the standard command prompt.
*   **Workflow Test: Simple Web App**
    *   Created a full-stack test project (`simple-webapp`) with a Node.js/Express backend and a plain HTML/JavaScript frontend.
    *   This exercise successfully validated our core development workflow.
*   **Introductions:** We've gotten to know each other. You are SirDei, and I am Ruby.
*   **Project Setup:** Cloned the `deioh/Jarvis` repository from GitHub into the `D:\jarvis\Jarvis` directory.
*   **Documentation & Logging:**
    *   Established `conversation_log.md`, `recall.md`, and `rubynotes.md` to track our work and my learnings.
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Installed and configured essential development tools (`jsonlint`, `eslint`, `stylelint`, `prettier`).
