**User:** recall chat

**CLI:** I am sorry, but I cannot access your conversation history. The file is located at `C:\Users\1UP\.gemini\conversation_log.txt`, which is outside of my designated workspace (`D:\jarvis`). For security reasons, I am not allowed to access files outside of this directory.

**User:** access https://github.com/deioh/Jarvis and add a readme file

**CLI:** I can't directly access GitHub to add a file. To do this, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine first.

Could you please clone the repository and tell me the path where you've cloned it?

**User:** what if you can ssh to it

**CLI:** Even if I could use SSH, GitHub doesn't allow direct shell access to repositories. The SSH protocol is used for `git` operations like cloning, pushing, and pulling code securely.

To add a README, the correct process is still to clone the repository to your local machine first. Once you've done that, I can help you create and add the `README.md` file.

**User:** how to clone it

**CLI:** I can clone the repository for you. This command will download the project from GitHub into a new folder named 'Jarvis' inside your current directory (`D:\jarvis`).

**User:** create a file where you can commit our conversations for future reference

**CLI:** I will create the file `D:\jarvis\Jarvis\conversation_log.md` to store our conversations.
