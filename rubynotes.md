## Running Frontend Applications

**Date:** July 4, 2025

**Context:** When running frontend applications, especially those scaffolded with tools like Vite, the standard command to start the development server is often `npm run dev`.

**Actionable Insight:** Always check the `package.json` file in the frontend directory for the `scripts` section to identify the correct command for starting the development server. Common commands include `npm run dev`, `npm start`, or `yarn dev`.
